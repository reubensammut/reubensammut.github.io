Hi there! I've created this blog to publish some stuff I'm working on, researching, 
or other stuff I find interesting. 

Hope you enjoy my content and find it useful. 

And hey, if you need to get in touch, I left my socials, you can contact me there ðŸ˜Š

I built this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is an easy setup to build a blog
as documented by [c3rb3ru5d3d53c](https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/hugo-and-obsidian/).
